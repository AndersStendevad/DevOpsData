abstract = { For Computer Systems, Computer Organization and Architecture courses in CS, EE, and ECE departments. Few students studying computer science or computer engineering will ever have the opportunity to build a computer system. On the other hand, most students will be required to use and program computers on a near daily basis. Computer Systems: A Programmers Perspective introduces the important and enduring concepts that underlie computer systems by showing how these ideas affect the correctness, performance, and utility of application programs. The text's hands-on approach (including a comprehensive set of labs) helps students understand the under-the-hood operation of a modern computer system and prepares them for future courses in systems topics such as compilers, computer architecture, operating systems, and networking.Visit the CSS:AP web page http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu for more information and resources. }
